        <h1>Tissue Reactions to an Implanted SU8 Structure</h1>
        <h2>A Flexible Study</h2>
        <h3 class="nomargin">Aim</h3>
        <p>
          To assess tissue damage as a result of shearing forces during and after implantation of a chronic neural implant.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Since the 70’s when neural interfaces were first described, the use and development of neural probes has only increased and are now used by many groups as a research tool. The long-term function of these devices depends greatly on them being biocompatible and long-term sta- ble. However, today, the produced interfaces do not fulfill these criteria.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have previously reported developing a new type of micromachined multielectrode array (MEA) based on a polymer resin (SU-8) [1], designed to minimize the tissue reaction around the bulk of the implant. Earlier findings show that the tissue reaction around a tethered implant is largest in the rostrocaudal direction of the CNS, they also show that size affect the gliosis[2]. Our MEA is at least an order of magnitude thinner than commercially available MEA:s, and therefore flexible in the preferred direction, i.e. in the rostro-caudal direction.
        </p>

        <h2>Study Design</h2>
        <p>
          Probes were made of a photosensitive polymer (SU8), approximately 5 μm thick. 50 μm stainless steel steering wires were mounted with sucrose to the implant, and some were also coated in a thin layer of type B gelatin. Brains were cryostat-sectioned horizontally (30 μm) and immunohistochemically stained for ED1 (activated microglia/macrophages), GFAP (reactive astrocytes), NeuN (neuronal nuclei), RIP (oligodendrocytes), NF200 (neurofilaments) and DAPI (cell nuclei). Sagittally and coronally oriented implants were compared to assess the tissue response.
        </p>

            </div>

          <p>
            GFAP: In both 50 μm and 200 μm region of interests, GFAP intensity decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) between sagittal and coronal groups. The effect of coating implants in lubricating gelatin prior to implantation showed a tendency towards improving astrocyte response, but variance was high, possibly due to contamination of the gelatin in the 24 hours between coating and surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            NeuN: Coronally, and gelatin coated implants in particular, tended toward a higher amount of surviving neurons. This phenomenon was demonstrated quantitatively by comparing NeuN cell density in the top and bottom GFAP-intensity quartiles of all groups.
          </p>

        <h3>12-week implantations</h3>
        <p>
          Astroglial (green) response to coronal implants after 12 weeks were similar in uncoated (left) and coated (right) groups. However, the tendency of some implants to produce a “halo” lacking both neurons and astrocytes observed in the 6 week groups remained in the 12 week groups, exemplified by the image on the right. Note the segment of SU-8 still left in the slice in this section.

          Quantitative analysis of neuronal counts at 12 weeks. Coated implants had slightly higher neuronal counts, in absolute numbers, than did uncoated. When compared to naive area of cerebral cortex (right graph), the relative survival of neurons could be quantified.

        <p>
          RIP shows significant differences in density between the tissue subjected to surgery and naive tissue at 6 weeks (p&lt;0.005). No statistical significance can be seen for the 12-week groups, and indeed even the variance is relatively low.
          Levels between 6 &amp; 12 weeks differ significantly (p&lt;0.05).
        <p>
        <img src="0639.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" />
        </p> 
        <p>
          When studying the ratio between RIP and NF200 it is clear that the relation between the amount of myelin and axons has been affected for the 6-week group (p&lt;0.001), and with a very low variance. The 12-week group on the other hand is approaching normal values, but the variance is visibly increased.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>
          Coronally aligned implants able to flex in the principle direction of tissue movement caused a significantly smaller astrogliosis.
        </li>

        <li>
          Some reactive astrocytosis surrounding the implant seems beneficial for neuron survival.
        </li>

        <li>
          A definite detrimental effect on myelin and/or oligodendrocytes after 6 weeks can be seen. However, by 12 weeks this seems to be corrected and levels are approaching normal.
        </li>

        <li>
          After 6 weeks we were able to show that the ratio between RIP and NF200 differ compared to naive. These results also follow the trend seen for myelin densities, in which normal levels are reached by 12 weeks.
